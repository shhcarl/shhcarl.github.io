    <h1>My Dearest, Ley</h1>
    <p>
      As much as I wanted to tell you this in person, I couldn’t quite gather the courage, so I decided to do it this way instead. If you're reading this letter, it means I’ve finally worked up the nerve to share how I feel about you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ve been talking for quite some time now, and I just wanted to clarify something that’s been on my mind for a while. I like you—genuinely, wholeheartedly. I wanted to be upfront about it because I think you deserve to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’re probably wondering why I like you or what made me feel this way. To be honest, I don’t have one specific answer. Maybe it’s because we may not have known each other for a long time yet, but in the time we’ve shared, there are so many qualities in you that I admire. From your kindness and warmth to the way you always seem to bring light into any conversation, it’s hard not to be drawn to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also find you incredibly beautiful—like, truly, breathtakingly beautiful—but it’s not just that. What makes you even more special is the kind of beauty that radiates from within. Your heart, your soul, the way you carry yourself—it’s all so much more than what meets the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      I adore your smile (please keep smiling), your eyes, and honestly, everything about you. And as much as I already like and admire you, I also want to get to know you more—to understand the little things about you that make you, you.
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s no pressure for you to respond right away. Take all the time you need to process this. Your feelings and thoughts are important, and I deeply respect whatever decision you make. Just know that regardless of anything, I’ll always be here for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for reading this and letting me share what’s in my heart.
    </p>
    <div class="signature">
      Yours truly,<br>
      James
